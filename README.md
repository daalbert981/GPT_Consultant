# GPT_Consultant## Setting the OpenAI API KeyTo set the OpenAI API key in your global environment, add the following line to your environment variables:```bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'```Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API key. This sets the key globally on your system.For a dedicated environment variable in a specific project, add the key to your `MAIN` file:```pythonimport openaiopenai.api_key = 'your-api-key'```## Compatibility NoteThe report generating function in this project is currently optimized for macOS.
